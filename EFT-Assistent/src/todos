Bugs:

 - PrimarySceneController: setMenuItemGodmodeStatus() FUTURE

2020 04 06 post-wipe feedback: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- hide empty categories has to be done for traders
- regret last completed quest.
Quest unlocked from start, that should not be:
 - Polikhim hobo
 - Postman pat - part 2
 - Hippocratic Vow


Nice improvements:
 - List quests after unlocking order
 - regret last complete
 - post man pat quests are wierd
DONE - Found in rate, rename to, FiR
DONE - Quests: for multiple maps, should be shown at all maps relevant, but greyed out
 - mouse drage for scrolling vert and hort
 - Quest text too long = goes out of screen, bottom row
 - Objectives with map names - map names should be marked more clearly / easier to see
 - GodMode should only be enabled at first launch
 - Only prompt user with "want to save box" if current state is different from saveSlot


Bugs:
- Vitamins part. 1 - NOT showing when in-game requirements is met
  - lvl22, LL3,3,2,2,2,2,1
  - Chemical part 3 completed
  - debug status: quests.json seems to be fine. Have i added it to edge case?
- post man pat quests are wierd
- Hippocratic Vow, Loyalty Buyout and No offence, is gated behind leveL?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Todos notes:
- move load and save features in QuestManager to other class?
- Tests for adding quests and such? Or at least manual tests!!
  - Does check for quests that has more than one quest requirement work?
- Move QuestLoader to data folder, and into JSONParserHelper, use common functions
- Make it possible to sort by either trader or map, to aid the starting process
- save on exit / auto save after x time


Todos (not so important ATM)(Listed in priority, first most important):
- Allow completion of a part of quests
- Regret level increase feature
  - Re-eval quests..


Future Work:
- QUest card info: requirements if locked and show maps if mixed
- Allow godmode to complete locked quests, and complete required recursively.
  - hint: QuestCardController: cardClicked(): if state = locked, if godmode ... code
- Mouse over questsCards for pop-up tips or maps?
- Found in raid items needed for future quests could be displayed and crossed out when found
- In a given state: Display weights/priority for which quests makes sense completing first
  - bundling multiple quests for same map
  - Punisher series
- Beginner and advanced mode
  - Advanced mode should display less text and require more in-game and quest knowledge
  - Beginner mode should be provide enough information so a beginner can
    complete all quests without using other information then whats in this app.
- Cheatsheet containing information on how to level each skill
- Runtime improvements:
  - QuestManager: store quests as maps<QuestId:int, Quest>
- Visual tool for debugging quest data
  - Graph of quest dependencies of other quests
- Testing:
  - Tests
    - Unit tests
    - check: is it possible to complete all quests?
  - Make it possible to start at a specific quest with all previous and non-related already completed.
- Information mode: searchable list of all quests showing their information.
- key spawn locations cheat sheet

Diagram todos:
 - Add main class and starting point of program
 - PaneAndController is used as a struct


Build notes:
 - Does saving and loading of files work?
 - ImageHandler: paths

In-game tests:
 - Does chem 3 unlock chem 4?
--------------------------------------------------
Odd cases needed to be handled:

#3 Case (FUTURE WORK)
Collector quest requires all other quests to be completed.

-------------------------
Quest adding notes:
Check first added quests for requirements
 - all prapor
 - 3 from Therapist


Make sure format for specific tings are the same:
 - Wearing requirements, make sure that they are under requirements
   - Maybe not - requirements are maybe only for items required for aiding in completion?
