model/QuestLoader:parseQuest - take care of objectives in objectives
model/QuestLoader:stringArrayToQObjectives - take care of objectives in objectives


Next todo: odd cases and rest of quests
        - next quest: skier: Informed means armed
     todo: fix load/save bugs

Bugs:
- Completing a quest, saving, and loading it, the quest is then not completed.
  - Seems to save the correct information

Todos:
- Add the rest of the quests
- Save and load system
- Move QuestLoader to data folder, and into JSONParserHelper, use common functions
- Maybe rework refreshing of model and visuals
  - Maybe just go through all code and cleanup code and structure


Todos (not so important ATM)(Listed in priority, first most important):
- Allow completion of a part of quests
- Regret level increase feature
  - Re-eval quests..

Visual improvements:
- Player level in two digits is turned into dots
- Remove "Requirements" from visuals if non is existing.

Future Work:
- Found in raid items needed for future quests could be displayed and crossed out when found
- In a given state: Display weights/priority for which quests makes sense completing first
- Beginner and advanced mode
  - Advanced mode should display less text and require more in-game and quest knowledge
  - Beginner mode should be provide enough information so a beginner can
    complete all quests without using other information then whats in this app.

Odd cases needed to be handled:

#1 Case
Prapor: Big customer
- req_quests
 - Chemical - Part 3
Prapor: No Offence
- req_quests
 - Chemical - Part 4 or Out of curiosity
    - Just add one, and it should be fine

#2 Case
Ops:
 - Completing some quests, completes also others: Big customer?
    - Add special case
 - Trust regain: require completion of one of two quests
    - Just add one or both of them, should be fine
 - Completing Big customer losses access to Trust Regain
    - Add special case


-------------------------
Quest adding notes:
Check first added quests for requirements
 - all prapor
 - 3 from Therapist

Missing ones:
 - Out of curiosity, missing id from Chemical - part 3
 - Trust regain, missing id from Chemical - part 4


No previous requirements for the quest: Postman Pat - Part 2 ????


Make sure format for specific tings are the same:
 - Wearing requirements, make sure that they are under requirements
   - Maybe not - requirements are maybe only for items required for aiding in completion?
 - Found in raid is noted in the same way.
